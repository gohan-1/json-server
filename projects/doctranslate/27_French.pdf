As a man walked past the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that
these huge creatures were only held back by a small rope attached to their paw
before. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that elephants could do anything
moment cut their ties, but for some reason they didn't.
 
He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals were just standing there and
made no attempt to escape. Well, said the coach, when they are very
young and much smaller, we use the same size of rope to tie them up and, at
this age, just hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe that they cannot
not separate. They think the rope can still hold them back, so they never try
to break free.
 
The man was amazed. These animals could free themselves from their bonds at any time, but
because they thought they couldn't, they were stuck where they were.
 
Like elephants, how many of us go through life believing that we don't
can't do something, just because we failed once
before?
 
Failure is part of learning; we must never give up the fight in the
life.
 
A man's favorite donkey falls over a deep precipice. He can't pull it off, little
matters its efforts. So he decides to bury him alive.
 
The soil is poured over the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it and walks on it.
More earth is poured.
 
He shakes it and goes up. The more the charge was poured, the more it rose. At noon the donkey was grazing
in the green pastures.
 
After shaking (problems) a lot And stepping up (learning from them), we will
graze in GREEN PASTURES.
